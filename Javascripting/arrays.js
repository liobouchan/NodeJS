/*# ARRAYS

An array is a list of values. Here's an example:

var pets = ['cat', 'dog', 'rat'];

### The challenge:

Create a file named arrays.js.

In that file define a variable named pizzaToppings that references an array that contains three strings in this order: tomato sauce, cheese, pepperoni.

Use console.log() to print the pizzaToppings array to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

javascripting verify arrays.js

var pizzaToppings = ['tomato sauce', 'cheese', 'pepperoni'];
console.log(pizzaToppings);

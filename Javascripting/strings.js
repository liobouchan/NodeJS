/*# STRINGS

A string is any value surrounded by quotes.

It can be single or double quotes:

'this is a string'

"this is also a string"

# NOTE

Try to stay consistent. In this workshop we'll only use single quotes.

## The challenge:

For this challenge, create a file named strings.js.

In that file create a variable named someString like this:

  var someString = 'this is a string';

Use console.log to print the variable someString to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

javascripting verify strings.js

var someString = 'this is a string';
console.log(someString);

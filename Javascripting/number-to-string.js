/*# NUMBER TO STRING

Sometimes you will need to turn a number into a string.

In those instances you will use the .toString() method. Here's an example:

  var n = 256;
  n = n.toString();

## The challenge:

Create a file named number-to-string.js.

In that file define a variable named n that references the number 128;

Call the .toString() method on the n variable.

Use console.log() to print the results of the .toString() method to the terminal.

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

javascripting verify number-to-string.js

var n = 128;
n = n.toString();
console.log(n);
